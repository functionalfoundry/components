# Workflo Components

Base components that can be used in different apps. These components are built
using a custom CSS-in-JS library that we built called JS Theme. It's themed
using the primitives in @workflo/styles.

To view the demos in storybook run
```
yarn
yarn storybook

Then navigate to `localhost:2000`
